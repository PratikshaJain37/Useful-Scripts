# Useful Scripts - A bunch of useful bits and bobs of code that help in general utility functions:)


## Index of Scripts

- [Document This](#Document-This) : For giving a format and structure (function wise) of the documentation of any python script
- [Sort Files](#Sort-Files) : For sorting and arranging files into subfolders based on file type

---


### Document-This
#### An Overview:

- When you run the script, you get a template of your python script, which makes documenting it easier, and helps you figure out how you have structured your document.
- The document also outputs all your comments.
- The document also tells you where (line number) you have used For/While loops, Try/Except/Else statement blocks, If/Elif/Else statement blocks, where you have called which function etc.
- You can check out the sample code and document [here](Samples/sample.py) and [here](Samples/sample_document.txt)

#### How To Use:

-  Set name_of_file variable as the Path+Name of your file, without extension.
- On your terminal, run:  
```python document_this.py ``` 
-  Success!

### Sort-Files
#### An Overview:

- When you run the script, you get a directory of subfolders which have all the files sorted, according to the file type
- For example, you can have all your images in one folder, etc.
- It's useful for helping you organize folders you've neglected and just stored random things in!

#### How To Use:

-  Set folder variable as the Path of the folder you want to arrange.
-  You can change/add file types and the subfolders, by editing the dictionary, called 'doctype_dict'
- On your terminal, run:  
```python sort_files.py ``` 
-  Success!
